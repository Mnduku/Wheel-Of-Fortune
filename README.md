- Play count can be either 1 - 4
- Rules are akin to regular Wheel of Fortune rules. Spin the wheel and then guess a letter. You will be awarded the wheels bonus for each amount of times the letter is found
- The spin's result is printed on the right-hand side
- SFX included
*note: Work in progress, wheel functionality needs revamp*
